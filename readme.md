# STM32 HAL Driver Development

## Introduction

This README provides guidance on developing STM32 drivers using the Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) API. These drivers are intended to interface with various hardware peripherals like GPIO, ADC, UART, SPI, and I2C on STM32 microcontrollers. Developing custom drivers is essential for accessing and controlling these peripherals effectively.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

* C/C++ programming skills.
* Knowledge of embedded systems development.
* Familiarity with microcontrollers, particularly STM32 microcontrollers.
* STM32 HAL libraries.
* STM32 microcontroller board (e.g., STM32F4xx).
* An integrated development environment (IDE) such as platform IO compatible with STM32 microcontrollers.

## Drivers

1. GPIO Driver
2. ADC Driver
3. UART Driver
4. SPI Driver
5. I2C Driver

## Contribution

Contributions to this project are highly encouraged and welcomed. If you want to enhance the existing drivers, add new drivers, or improve documentation, please feel free to submit pull requests. Your contributions can help the community in developing better STM32 driver libraries.
